# lambeq

``lambeq`` is an open-source, modular, extensible high-level Python library for experimental Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP), created by [CQC](https://cambridgequantum.com)'s QNLP team. At a high level, the library allows the conversion of any sentence to a quantum circuit, based on a given compositional model and certain parameterisation and choices of ans√§tze.

**lambeq will be officially launched on Wednesday, October 13 2021.** 

In the meantime, you can have a look at the paper below which introduces the toolkit and presents its basic usage:
